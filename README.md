# React Portfolio Playground
This repository contains experimental React components and layout prototypes created as part of my process to build a personal portfolio site.

## Purpose
- Practice core React concepts (state, props, effects, routing)
- Develop reusable UI components for future portfolio use
- Explore design layouts and page flows
- Iterate in isolation before full site integration

## Stack
- React (Vite)
- HTML/CSS
- React Router
- Other libraries:

## Structure
/src
/components # Reusable UI components (e.g., cards, headers)
/pages # Page mockups or layout drafts
/hooks # Custom React hooks (if any)
App.js
index.js


## Notes
- Code here is not intended for production.
- Some components may be incomplete, redundant, or unstyled.
- Commit history reflects iterative exploration, not final design choices.

## Roadmap
- [x] Basic JSX + component props
- [ ] State and events
- [ ] Routing and navigation flow
- [ ] Dynamic content via JSON or API mock
- [ ] Theming and responsive layout
- [ ] Deployable version of full portfolio
